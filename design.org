#+TITLE: Dungeon Crawl Design Document

* Project Name: Rusty Roguelike
** Short Description
A Dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels, monsters of increasing difficulty, and turn based movement
** Story
The hero's hometown is suffering from a plague of monsters. Welling up from the deep, they seem unstoppable. Legend tells of the Amulet of Yala that can be used to stem the tide. After a long night at the tavern, the hero promises to save the day - and sets forth into the dungeon.
** Basic Game Loops
1. Enter the dungeon level.
2. Explore, revealing the map.
3. Encounter enemies whom the player fights or flees from.
4. Find powerups and use them to strengthen the player.
5. Locate the exit - go to 1.
